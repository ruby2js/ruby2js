Check it out [here](https://www.ruby2js.com/demo).

Because the conversion from Ruby to JavaScript is fast and runs right in your
browser, this demo will update the converted output keystroke-by-keystroke as
you enter your code.  Find and fix your syntax errors, select the right
filters and options, and ensure the JavaScript to be generated is what you
intend before you commit your code.

Or just use it to learn idiomatic equivalents to common Ruby language
patterns.  Just be sure to select a modern `eslevel`, and liberally add
filters, particularly filter `functions`.

Under the covers, it is running the same
[ruby2js](https://github.com/ruby2js/ruby2js) code, just converted from Ruby
to JavaScript using the excellent [Opal](https://opalrb.com/) converter.

See a conversion that either isn't quite right or isn't the best it can be?
[Let us know](../../docs/community/#ways-to-contribute)!

Why Opal?  Because it is the
[right tool for this job](../../docs/choose-your-tool).
