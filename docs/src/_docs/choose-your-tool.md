If you simply want to get a job done with a rich Ruby runtime and well-tested
framework, and only use one of the many integrations that
[Opal](https://opalrb.com/) provides, then Opal is the way to go.

**Ruby2JS** is for those that want to produce JavaScript that looks like it
wasn’t machine generated, and want the absolute bare minimum in terms of
limitations as to what JavaScript can be produced.

[Try](/demo) for yourself.  
[Compare with Opal](https://opalrb.com/try/#code:).

And, of course, the right solution might be to use
[CoffeeScript](https://coffeescript.org/) instead. 😉
