Juntos bridges two worlds:

- **Rails developers** gain access to platforms Rails can't reach—browser, edge, mobile, desktop
- **JavaScript developers** gain access to the Rails ecosystem—ActiveRecord, validations, associations, conventions

## From JavaScript Frameworks

You know the framework. Juntos adds the Rails ecosystem—ORM, validations, associations—without leaving your familiar patterns.

| Your Background | What You Gain |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **[React](/docs/juntos/coming-from/react)** | ActiveRecord in your components, same hooks you know |
| **[Vue](/docs/juntos/coming-from/vue)** | Full ORM, cleaner Composition API, same templates |
| **[Svelte](/docs/juntos/coming-from/svelte)** | Database queries in components, same reactive syntax |
| **[Next.js](/docs/juntos/coming-from/nextjs)** | Rails patterns in your API routes and pages |
| **[Astro](/docs/juntos/coming-from/astro)** | ORM in frontmatter, multi-framework islands |

## From Static Site Generators

You have a content-focused site. Juntos adds ActiveRecord-like queries over your markdown content.

| Your Background | What You Gain |
|-----------------|---------------|
| **[11ty/Eleventy](/docs/juntos/coming-from/eleventy)** | Query content like a database, familiar Liquid templates |
| **[VitePress](/docs/juntos/coming-from/vitepress)** | Ruby Vue components, content collections |
| **[Nuxt](/docs/juntos/coming-from/nuxt)** | Rails query syntax replaces queryContent() |
| **[Bridgetown](/docs/juntos/coming-from/bridgetown)** | Ruby everywhere—templates, components, and JavaScript |

## From Rails

You know Rails. Juntos takes those patterns to platforms Rails can't reach.

**[Coming from Rails](/docs/juntos/coming-from/rails)** — Deploy to browser, edge, mobile, and desktop with the same models and conventions you already know.
