The **React** filter enables you to build [React](https://react.dev/) components.

The examples below are based on examples from the
[React](https://react.dev/) website.  For best results:

 * Review the [React](https://react.dev/) website first, and refer to it as
   you work through each example that follows.  Compare the Ruby source and the
   JavaScript that is generated from these pages.

 * Change the Ruby source code in your browser and see how the JavaScript
   and results change.

## Examples

As you go through these examples, you will see that there are multiple ways to
do things (for example, three ways to express HTML, two ways to access state).
This enables you to chose between adopting a more JavaScript/JSX style or a
more Ruby/Markaby/builder style.  Feel free to mix and match the various
approaches, even within the scope of a single method.
